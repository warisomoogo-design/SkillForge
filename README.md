## üìã Smart Contract Features

### 1. Skill Verification Contract
- **Skill NFT Minting**: Create unique NFTs representing verified skills (e.g., "React Developer Level 3")
- **Peer Validation System**: Allow other verified users to stake tokens to validate someone's skill demonstration
- **Skill Challenges**: Create and manage coding challenges, design tasks, or other skill-based tests
- **Evidence Storage**: Store IPFS hashes of portfolios, code repositories, and project demonstrations
- **Skill Decay Mechanism**: Implement time-based skill relevance (skills need periodic re-validation)

### 2. Reputation & Trust Contract
- **Reputation Scoring**: Calculate and store reputation scores based on completed projects and peer reviews
- **Trust Network**: Build web-of-trust relationships between users
- **Slashing Mechanism**: Penalize users who provide false validations or fail to deliver on commitments
- **Reputation Staking**: Allow users to stake their reputation on others' skills or project outcomes

### 3. Project Escrow Contract
- **Multi-milestone Escrow**: Lock funds for projects with multiple deliverable milestones
- **Dispute Resolution**: Implement a decentralized arbitration system using randomly selected qualified peers
- **Automatic Releases**: Release payments automatically when milestones are approved by clients
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: Allow fund recovery in case of abandoned projects (with time locks)

### 4. Learning Pool Contract
- **Study Group Formation**: Create and manage peer learning groups with shared goals
- **Knowledge Bounties**: Post bounties for creating educational content or solving learning challenges
- **Mentorship Matching**: Pair experienced users with learners based on skills and availability
- **Learning Progress Tracking**: Record and verify completion of learning milestones

### 5. Governance & DAO Contract
- **Platform Governance**: Vote on platform parameters, fee structures, and new features
- **Skill Category Management**: Community-driven addition and modification of skill categories
- **Dispute Resolution Rules**: Govern the arbitration process and penalty structures
- **Treasury Management**: Manage platform fees and community rewards distribution

### 6. Token Economics Contract
- **SKILL Token**: Native utility token for staking, governance, and platform fees
- **Staking Rewards**: Distribute rewards to users who stake on skill validations
- **Fee Distribution**: Share platform revenue with active community members
- **Liquidity Mining**: Reward early adopters and active participants

### 7. Identity & Privacy Contract
- **Decentralized Identity**: Link wallet addresses to professional identities while maintaining privacy
- **Selective Disclosure**: Allow users to prove specific skills without revealing full portfolio
- **Anonymous Skill Challenges**: Enable skill testing without revealing identity until after completion
- **Professional Verification**: Optional integration with traditional credential systems

### 8. Marketplace Contract
- **Project Posting**: Create and manage freelance project listings with detailed requirements
- **Skill-based Matching**: Automatically match projects with qualified freelancers
- **Bid Management**: Handle competitive bidding with skill-weighted proposals
- **Success Fee Distribution**: Distribute platform fees based on project completion success

## üíª Usage Examples

### Minting a Skill NFT

\`\`\`javascript
import { StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';
import { makeContractCall } from '@stacks/transactions';

const mintSkill = async (skillName, level, evidenceHash) => {
  const txOptions = {
    contractAddress: 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7',
    contractName: 'skill-verification',
    functionName: 'mint-skill',
    functionArgs: [
      stringAsciiCV(skillName),
      uintCV(level),
      stringAsciiCV(evidenceHash)
    ],
    network: new StacksTestnet(),
    anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
  };
  
  return await makeContractCall(txOptions);
};
\`\`\`

### Validating a Skill

\`\`\`javascript
const validateSkill = async (skillId, stakeAmount) => {
  const txOptions = {
    contractAddress: 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7',
    contractName: 'skill-verification',
    functionName: 'validate-skill',
    functionArgs: [
      uintCV(skillId),
      uintCV(stakeAmount)
    ],
    network: new StacksTestnet(),
    anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
  };
  
  return await makeContractCall(txOptions);
};
\`\`\`
